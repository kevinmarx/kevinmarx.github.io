## Designing in the browser, creating rapid prototypes for rapid development.

I have been recently tasked with designing and developing a new application which will be my first real design project in over a year (See my [previous post](/2013/10/06/a-year-without-design.html)) . I approached the project like I had so many times in the past starting with rough sketches and then moving into Photoshop and Illustrator, but I found that I no longer had the patience for these tools; I found them cumbersome and slow and since I then had to build whatever interface I created in Photoshop, I was essentially building it twice. So I went to the browser.

Designing for the web means that your medium is code, so working in the browser just makes sense. In the browser you can work out interactivity, flows, quirks that you just don't encounter in a Photoshop document. You quickly begin thinking about reuse-ability and structure in your design.

A process that I have found to be beneficial is to build out the structure and your typographic hierarchies with very little aesthetics. With a working prototype you now have something to talk about, get buy-in, receive feedback, and axe what isn't working. Once you have the structure and flows in place you now have a wealth to build your aesthetic layer upon.

Working this way also allows you to get client or management buy-in as an iterative process, rather than all at once after spending many hours on multiple mock-ups that will then have to rounds of revisions and then need to be converted to code. In my experience this approach reduces late stage trajectory changing alterations to the project since all the stakeholders have had input throughout the process.

OK, so let's talk about a few drawbacks. Many I have experienced are temporary as they are due to getting everyone to commit to changing their process. Obviously this only works if you are either very comfortable working with code or work very closely with a developer throughout the process. Convincing your stakeholders might be a paint point as well as many are used to the traditional method of getting rounds of creative rather than being involved throughout the process. Sometimes you throw out a pivotal point that can require some challenging restructuring of code and/or the UI, which I think the time gains of this process outweigh a few longer revisions.

I work with two others on my team and we've been using this process for a little over 4 months with great success. We augmented this process with building our prototypes with a test suite and maintaining code quality, this way when we get the green light we can ship the prototype with confidence. If you give this process a try on your next project, I would be interested in hearing how it works for you.
