excerpt: Working remotely while still going into the office.
---

Eight months ago, five collegues and I found ourselves on a team tasked with building a new product. At the time all six of us worked together going into the office every day. Within a few months we had two members move halfway accross the country, but continue to work with us as remote employees. With a third of our team now not in the office everyday, we had to quickly figure out how to keep them included.

We had a company chat room on Campfire but most of the conversation was office banter involving gifs. There were only a few different rooms, and you had to ask an administrator to create or join another room. About the time we learned one of our team members was moving away, a new product called Slack was released. A few of us set up our organization and started using Slack for our communication. Yes, for about a month we had chat conversations happening in two different applications. It wasn't until we had another team member moving away to become a remote worker did we adopt Slack as our "official" chat program.

###The transition to remote.

At first our team worked like most, everyone would come into the office and anything that needed to be discussed would result in a meeting being scheduled. A few weeks into the project we had a team member move across the country. And we struggled to keep him included in discussions happening at the office. We continued to have meetings where we would try to remember to include our remote employee via Google Hangouts. We were very bad at it, he was constantly left out and becoming very frustrated.

It wasn't until our second team member moved away did we finally get our act together. We finally made sure that we had a hangout set up for any meeting that we had. We also made an effort to have more of our conversations in our chat room. However, we were still having conversations in the office that our remote employees were missing out on.

The transition was almost effortless now. Out of necessity we found ourselves using chat more and more. We work in a very open office environment and you can easily talk or yell to your fellow deskmates about anything. But we found ourselves now using chat to even talk to the person sitting directly next to you. This was paramount to our final transition into being a well run remote working machine. Now virtually everything we said to each other every day was either recorded for all to see or in direct messages to one another.

This meant we were now having many of the meetings we used to have in the chatroom. We were no longer worried about leaving anyone out of a meeting. Everyone on the team could read what was being discussed wheather it involved them or not. Everyone was now always up to date on the current state of the application, so when we went to work on a section we were less familiar with we required less time to do knowledge transfer. Also when someone was looking for more information on a feature they would do so in the project chat room rather than in private messages allowing the whole team to either contribute or listen. We found that chat just kept things fluid, where physically talking to someone usually required them stopping what they were doing to respond, chat was asynchronous.

###The last step.

We don't really pair program in the traditional sense. Each of us will work on a given feature until completion. But when our featuere overlaps with another feature someone else is working on, we will work in tandem. This was the last thing we finally learned how to do remotely as it required changes into how we thought about working in git. Previously this meant sitting next to someone and staring at the same screen and committing code on one computer.
