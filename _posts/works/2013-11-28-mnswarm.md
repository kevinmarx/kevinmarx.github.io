Shortly following the launch of the new National Lacrosse League website, the MN Swarm wanted to refresh
their online image as well. With a full design refresh and a few custom features, the Swarm had a new
robust online presence.

The Swarm previously had a very animated site, so I worked with the designer to implement some subtle css
animations throughout the site to give them that interactivity they desired without being overpowering.

One of the primary goals of this site was to drive ticket sales so I developed an upcoming games ticker in their header
that would allow them to upload their schedule and link out to their ticketing platform for their home games.
