The National Sports Center in Blaine, MN is the largest sports complex in the world, which meant they had
a large amount of content and a need for a robust CMS. With four independent web properties, one of our challenges
was integrating their sites into a more unified brand.

Even though we were using a CMS for their site, they wanted to have edit access to nearly everything that wasn't page structure.
So I developed an interface for them to be able to upload images into their dropdown navigation and various other locations that would
have been normally locked down through the CMS. We also ported over nearly all of their content from their old site giving them a seamless transition.

The USA Cup is the world's largest youth soccer tournament. With teams from around the world playing, this site received high traffic.
We used their newly developed theme from the parent site extending the theme in areas where the site had custom needs.

The Velodrome and Victory Links where the last two of their website properties and utilized a slightly modified version of the NSC Theme.
