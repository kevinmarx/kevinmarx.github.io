The Edmonton Rush, part of the National Lacrosse League, wanted to expand their online experience
with new features and a new design. I was responsible for the front-end development and interaction design on
this project. Working closely with the designer we were able to craft an online experience that matched the team's personality.

I developed a modular layout with the positioning of the elements driving the styles. The CMS choice provided the user with
a drag and drop interface for organizing their page so the styles needed to update on the fly without a full page reload.

I also developed a photo and video agregator for the team allowing their fans to upload videos and photos that would then be
admin curated prior to posting on their site.

The team liked a schedule ticker widget I had previously developed so the functionality was integrated into their site allowing
them to have their upcoming games shown in their header with links out to their ticketing platform for home games.
