The West Broadway Area Coalition was our non-profit client in the 2013 Nerdery Overnight Website Challenge.
We developed a site to help promote the businesses and neighborhoods of West Broadway in North Minneapolis.

I developed a searchable business directory for their site so users can find businesses in their neighborhood. We extended the functionality
to allow businesses to claim their listing and add job postings and their Google Places account to their profile on the site.

We developed the site to be fully responsive through pure CSS.
