Winner of the 2012 Nerdery Overnight Website Challenge, WAMM was an organization with many needs for their website.

With the design being so modular and their needs for a fully responsive site, we decided to try using the CSS3 Flex-Box model
for this site. This allowed us to easily flow content as the screen sizes changed. This also allowed us to normalize the heights
of a section to the largest content for that seamless mosaic look. Due to the Flex-Box model being not highly supported we then had
to degrade the site gracefully for browsers that did not support this technology.

Another request from WAMM was to have an intranet that they could use while in Africa where the internet connections are not the
fastest. So we developed a slimmed down theme for them to use to host all their internal documents so their employees could log in
from a slow connection and still receive content quickly.

Because we used the Flex-Box model we were able to develop a mobile site rather quickly because the content would flow automatically
as the screen size got smaller. It also helped that most mobile browsers supported this technology.
