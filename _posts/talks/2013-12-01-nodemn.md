## I gave a talk at our local NodeJS users group about natural language processing with Hubot.

You can view my slides <a href="http://www.kevinmarx.net/Building-Your-Robot-Butler-2013" target="_blank">here.</a>

I have included my notes for the presentation below.

# How To Train Your Robot

## Not that kind of robot

## This kind of robot

## What is this robot you speak of?
### Enter: Hubot
### What is Hubot?
* Hew-bot
* A Customizable, Kegorator-Powered Life Embetterment Robot
* Written in Node.js and Coffeescript
* Uses Redis to persit data in its "Robot Brain"

## What is Coffeescript?
* CoffeeScript is an attempt to expose the good parts of JavaScript in a simple way.
* Written By Jeremy Ashkenas
* Compiles to vanilla Javascript, with no interpretation at runtime

## So what do you use Hubot for?
* Originally as a chat bot and to automate running tests etc.
* Generating memes
* General time-wasting

## How do you use Hubot?
### Adapters
* connects Hubot to the outside world
### Syntax sugar that is coffeescript

### Scripts
* Repo managed by github
* stuff the robot actually does

### Script
* Two ways .respond and .hear, respond requires a prompt (primary way)
* `send` the message out

## But wait there's more!
* I started thinking about how limiting pre-built life-embetterment robots were
* Hubot is command driven, Siri and Google I have little control over their tasks
* What if I could merge the two?

## Enter: Natural Language Processing
* I started looking into how I could get Hubot to understand me more naturally
* My wife's a Master of English so I began asking her to re-teach me english syntax
* How do I get the computer to understand English?
* Tokenizing, trying to find relevant words etc.
* Started building my own language processor...really, really hard.

## To the Googles!
* Started looking for open source natural language processors for node.js
* Not nearly as roboust as I wanted

### What I found
* Stanford Language Processor
  - Java App
  - Had node run it in a sub shell and pass it stuff
  - Really slow
  - Returns garbage, so I needed to create an adapter to conver to JSON

#### Still not what I wanted

## Enter: Elastic Search
* Combined with the HTML Web Speech API
* I could now just send the entire string and get weighted results

## So How'd you do it
* Well naturally I named my robot Jarvis
* And naturally I wanted him to speak in a British accent

### Enter: ElasticSearch
* I could now just send plain english to my database and get weighted results
* results will have a string that will match one of the hubot scripts regex, low manipulation of hubot core.
*
### Enter: i18next
* Run all of the robot's responses through tranlsation
* Sectioning out the parts of speech
* Localizing responses to time of day and randomizing similar response phrases

## What Does It Look Like?
* SQLite
* Elastic Search
* Rails
* Node (Hubot)
* XMPP

## Why Rails
* I looked at node options for elastic search apis and found that for speed of development and general niceness the Tire gem was great.
* Good Practice

#### The Gift of Speech
- Hijack Apple's speech files to get a cool British accent
- Have node execute `say` commands in a sub shell to get the robot talking

##### Spike: Language is inherently synchronous, Node is not
- The robot was talking over himself
- Quick touch on the async library and managing control flows with node
- Show stupid binding in coffeescript

### Nitty Gritty
* XMPP adapter for Hubot for use with a web interface
* Jarvis talks to his "Brain" which is a SQLite with a rails server on top
* uses XMPP
* Why Rails? Because the Tire gem is amazeballs
* The "brain" responds with an "executable" object which node will then parse the json and execute the function contained in the object.
* Still uses is lesser Redis brain for simple things

## What's next?
* I would like to build a more robust web interface for him so that he can respond with visuals as well as audio and text
