## Over the past year I have effectively designed nothing. Instead I spent that time programming.

I would like to dedicate this post to those designers who have made the leap to the dark side. I started my transition a little over a year ago, this was/is my journey.

I, for the better part of my career, have been what many label as an Interactive Designer. I worked at an advertising agency in Minneapolis making things for clients on the web. Yes at the time I “knew” how to code, and by code I mean browser only HTML CSS and very limited JavaScript. My primary duty was not to program, it was to design.

It was about my second year in the idustry and I was starting to feel stagnated in my current position. I found myself wanting to get better at programming due to the irregular results I was getting from our vendors implementing my designs.

Being completely unqualified at the time for many of the mid-level Interactive positions I applied anyways and I, *ahem*, padded my stats. I was offered a position that was about 60% implementing other's designs on our CMS. I was promptly thrown in the deep end; I started sinking. I was about a month in and I knew that my basic knowledge of CSS and JavaScript wasn't cutting it. So I took myself back to school. Each weeknight I went home after work and scoured the internet for resources on how I could learn this stuff. I quickly learned enough to be dangerous with JavaScript and was able to use jQuery to change the CMS I worked on to do my bidding. I was still a beginner, I had merely read the manual.

Towards the end of my first year at my new job I was asked to join the development team as a UI/UX Designer, in which the essence of that title lasted one week. We had just started an aggressive development effort on some new applications and were shorthanded on the front-end development staff. And since I knew a fair amount of JavaScript I was asked to fill the gap. I was once again tossed in the deep end and reminded how little I actually did know about programming.

Back to the internet for more tutorials; I was leveling my skills up rather quickly, I then hit a wall. I was at the point where the internet could no longer help me, I kept looking for tutorials, anything that could help me understand the now advanced tasks I was being asked to do. Everything that I've found required this missing basic peice of knowledge on programming languages that I didn't have or even know what to look for.

There was this seemingly basic understanding of how computers actually worked that I didn't have. Up until this point I was only reading manuals. I was copying without fully understanding what was taking place. A year ago I couldn't have told you what prototypal and classical inheritance were let alone how they work. I didn't know how data flowed through a program, how objects were created in memory, how they were cleaned up. I didn't fully understand the callstack and how the things I was writing were being executed. This was the missing piece, this was the knowledge that allows programmers to grasp a new language quickly.

How did I finally learn this critical nugget of information you may ask. To be honest I don't know. It was a lot of late nights and a lot of failures. It was nine months of feeling like the dumbest person at the office. I also had a few very helpful co-workers offering me advice, albeit snarky at times. Once I got over this once insurmountable wall, everything just clicked, I was cookin' with gas now.

I just recently was asked to start work on a new application where I am to play both the role of UX design and front-end development. I can tell you transistioning back was rough, you get out of practice. I found myself hating Phototshop and Illustrator, two tools I once thought integral now were just getting in my way. I wasn't able to design in the same way I had in the past. My brain was constantly switching from designer to developer and back again. I would design something and then immediately think about how it was going to be built and how the data would be structured or where the data might come from.

My design process had to radically change. The only way I could unify the two diciplines was through flows. Understanding the objectives of the user when interacting with a section of the app. When designing mockups you are forced to think about views as “pages” because they are flat and lack interactivity. This instantly causes a massive overhead of having to communicate intent and always babysitting the production of the feature, and since I had to keep track of both, this workflow just wouldn't work. Getting into the code and making quick prototypes was the only way I could work effectively.

This brings me to my final topic, that age old debate: Should a designer code?
Are you making things for the web? Then in some capacity, yes. If you're designing the graphic sugar on a system where the data and ux are already done for you, then your medium is pixels and CSS/HTML. If you are a UX Designer, most definitely. You are building user interfaces for raw data. I don't believe that anyone could do this job effectively without a comfortable knowledge of how it all works. I also think knowing how your particular data will make your interfaces better, faster, stronger, when it comes to usability and technical speed.

I apologize for such a ramble of a post, I just needed to dump my brain on this topic. I hope this post comes in handy for anyone struggling to get over that hump when learning how to program. If you just commit to it, it'll come in time.
