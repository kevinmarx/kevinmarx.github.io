I have a background in design, however, lately, I've been doing some thinking with regards to agile development. I find it interesting that between the two professions, comparisons can be made.

In order to see these comparisons, an understanding of agile development is necessary. According to the Agile Manifesto ([found here](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)), the most important priority is to satisfy customers' needs and in order to do this, change needs to be welcomed, in order to keep competition strong. Furthermore, in-person communication and a strong relationship between business and development is crucial. This is so the wants and needs of any given customer is met to the highest standard.

Based on firsthand experience, I know that design has an expressive nature. Because of this, I believe that design has agile tendencies. For example, a project will evolve as the designer progresses and receives feedback. Most of the time, however, the design process is rigid and synchronous, when looking at how it fits into a company's overall work-flow, on any given project.

Lets take a look at a traditional project work-flow. The designer receives the creative brief and begins to work on mock-ups, many times alone, or with a small group, acting alone. Then, designers present their work to creative directors, account managers, etc. and receive internal feedback in which they make changes, and ultimately, present the first-round to the client.

Many times, the development team isn't involved until the the first-round is presented to the client. Interestingly, however, I am seeing this trend occur much earlier. Traditionally, in my experience, development doesn't start until the design has gone through multiple rounds of revisions and has been ultimately approved by the client. This work-flow inevitably causes the timelines to expand. When the project enters development, the final design continues to be iterated. This usually results in developers' involvement with any design changes. This is where I think the system starts to break down. Many times, you start to over-engineer and over-think the problems because you have been asked to think about these future features and implementations before you even have built much at all.

This is where the Agile Manifesto comes into play. Involve the development staff from the beginning having them build early and ship often. Ideally presenting to the client should be live prototypes and not flats, then changes you make are iterative changes, not entirely new development. This also goes a long way in presenting interactivity and flows, often times this is overlooked when working primarily with flats. Developers need to be OK with throwing away code, rewriting, then throwing it away again. This is a concept that I think the design profession is more used to. Receiving feedback and being OK with throwing away much of what you made, but then taking what is left and continuing on.

Agile encourages working in small groups, having people work in departments breaks down communication. Instead having project teams that include only the people necessary to complete the project aids in the speed and ease of communication between disciplines. In my experience having smaller project teams reduces the project time line because the team is able to work more asynchronously and will have less roadblocks along the way.

Also I encourage every designer that is working on any interactive project to work in the browser and build HTML prototypes of their design. This will remove the tedious process of converting a flat to HTML and for elements to get lost in translation. I also encourage every developer to prototype like they mean it, test your code. With this work flow the goal is to ship what you prototyped so having tests lets you ship with confidence. A extensive test suite as you build also makes shifts in direction less painful, you'll be able to see what your changes affect throughout the project instantly.

Currently I have been on a team in the process of taking a more agile approach to our work flow. One of the biggest misconceptions I've encountered is the thought that agile primarily means ship often. In the beginning projects would still come into development nearly complete in all other aspects. This caused us to believe that shipping faster meant the work was getting done faster and any changes in direction would be considered “out of scope” and therefore put on hold. This would cause us to finish a project only to have to rework it with all the new changes that were piling up as we stayed the course. We would ship features with partial functionality and the Minimum Viable Product was something that was not unified and felt incomplete. Once you or your team starts throwing around the term “that's not needed for MVP” you need to re-assess your project priorities and make sure that this MVP is the product or feature you're happy to put your name on. This can result in a meeting with the client to discuss time lines and feature sets, if you come prepared a compromise can almost always be found.

I encourage everyone to try agile, it can be a difficult change at first but once you get the teams right, you'll see gains in velocity and reductions in time lines. Always pay attention to the synchronous tasks, it's inevitable. If you do your best to foresee the roadblocks you are better able to adjust your work flow so that you're always moving and idle time is reduced to a minimum.
The transition is a journey but a worthwhile endeavour that will increase productivity and even morale.
